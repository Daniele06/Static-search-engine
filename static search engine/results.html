            <p>A <b>polar bear</b> might catch only one or two out of 10 seals it hunts, depending on the time of year
                and
                other variables. Their diet mainly consists of ringed and bearded seals because they need large amounts
                of fat to survive. <b>Polar bears</b> rely heavily on sea ice for traveling, hunting, resting, mating
                and, in
                some areas, maternal dens.

            <p><b>Polar bears</b> live alone. <b>Polar bears</b> are black with clear fur, so in daylight, they appear white; at
                night, they are invisible. Young <b>Polar bears</b> stay with their mothers for 1-2 years, and they become
                mature when they are 5-6 years old. People think <b>Polar bears</b> can become 25-30 years old in nature, but
                in captivity (for example, in zoos), they can become up to 45 years old.
